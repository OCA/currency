This module provides basic support for the management of cryptocurrencies.

#. Cryptocurrencies are commonly considered property from a
   taxation standpoint.

#. This means that every time that you receive or send cryptocurrencies, you
   are entering into a taxable transaction, and will need to report on the
   gain/loss resulting from the receipt/issue of the cryptocurrency.

#. When you receive cryptocurrencies (in exchange for goods delivered,
   service rendered or because you mined it), that translates into taxable
   income to the recipient. The valuation should be based on the market value of
   the cryptocurrency at the time of receipt, and it can be provided by a
   third party (e.g. the exchange platform) or needs to be identified by
   you somehow.

#. You have to retain the cost of the crytptocurrency for as long as you keep
   it.

#. When you pay out cryptocurrencies (in exchange for goods or services
   purchased, or if you exchanged for another crypto or normal currency) this
   constitutes again a taxable transaction. In that case the gain/loss is
   computed as the difference between the cost of the cryptocurrency that
   you pay with, and the value of what you receive back, valued in your
   operating normal currency.
