The module supports multi-company currency in two ways:

* when currencies are shared, you can set currency update only on one
  company
* when currencies are separated, you can set currency on every company
  separately

A function field lets you know your currency configuration.

If in multi-company mode, the base currency will be the first company's
currency found in database.
